The words **library**, **module** and **package** roughly mean the same thing; it is entirely natural to be confused by this!
- **Library** : a collection of python files that expand the ability of python, using the `import` command. These are like accessories or modifications, typically giving you access to powerful, professional functions and classes written by collaborations of expert coders. 
  - A library can be [standard](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) (it comes built into python), for example `time` or `math`, or
  - 3rd party, so, not a core part of python itself and will need to be installed.
- **Package** : a library that is available for delivery to a package manager, such as `pip` or `conda`. [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) is the main package storehouse for python.
- **Module** : anything that is imported to a main running script. Libraries and packages are made of modules.

### Python experience
This workshop aims to be as inclusive as possible! But to get the most out of it you should have some experience with Python. To engage with the practical tasks and build your own platform with Streamlit you should 
* have experience of the [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library (if you have attended our [courses](https://milliams.com/courses/data_analysis_python/) on [data analysis](https://milliams.com/courses/applied_data_analysis/), that is perfect!)
* be familiar with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) - we also have [a course on that!](https://milliams.com/courses/ides_debugging/)
* some experience of using the [command line](https://alleetanner.github.io/intro-to-command-line/) is also expected.

We will recap some important coding concepts like `import`ing, creating functions using `def`, and how to work with dataframes. Streamlit encourages a "linear" coding style, and uses the Pandas dataframe as a foundation.sdfio no

### Installing required software
You will need Python version 3.10 or higher installed on your machine. You can check what version you have installed with the command `python3 --version`. If you need to upgrade, search for a guide to follow on how to do that for your operating system. 

We also need to install some packages
